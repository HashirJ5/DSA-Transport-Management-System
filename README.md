# Project2
Excited to share my recent Data Structures & Algorithms end of semester project â€” a Transport Management System that applies core DSA concepts to solve real-world challenges in transport and logistics.

Key Concepts & Tools Used:

-Hash Table with Linear Probing for efficient record storage

-Linked List for managing trip data dynamically

-Queue for handling service and passenger lines

-Stack for undo operations and activity tracking

-File Handling for persistent data management



This project really helped me deepen my practical understanding of how different data structures can work together in a real application. 



Big thanks to Muhammad Yar khan for the help and support throughout the project.

 Grateful to Dr. Saneeha Aamir for the her guidance and valuable feedback!
