# Project2
Excited to share my recent Data Structures & Algorithms end of semester project — a Transport Management System that applies core DSA concepts to solve real-world challenges in transport and logistics.

Key Concepts & Tools Used:

-Hash Table with Linear Probing for efficient record storage

-Linked List for managing trip data dynamically

-Queue for handling service and passenger lines

-Stack for undo operations and activity tracking

-File Handling for persistent data management



This project really helped me deepen my practical understanding of how different data structures can work together in a real application.
